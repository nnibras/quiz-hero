                <p class="text-center font-bold">What is the difference between map, filter, foreach and find?</p>
                <p class="text-justify flex justify-center">Ans: All of these are functions in JS that allow to carry
                    out
                    some sort of
                    functional programming.
                    <br>
                    i- map transforms every element of an array or object and returns a new array or an object with the
                    same length. <br>
                    ii- filter returns a new array or an object with only the elements that meet the condition provided.
                    <br> iii- foreach applies a function to every element of an array or object without returning
                    anything. <br>
                    iv- find returns the first element in an array or object that meets the given condition.

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-center">Question 2</h2>
                <p class="text-center font-bold">What is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage and cookie?
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify flex justify-center">Ans: All of these are processes of storing data in browser
                    itself. <br>
                    i- localStorage is a storage mechanism that allows web applications to store
                    key-value pairs in the
                    browser. The data stored in localStorage stays in the browser even after the browser is closed or
                    the user logs out of the website. <br>

                    ii- sessionStorage is similar to localStorage, but the data stored in sessionStorage is lost when
                    the user closes the browser or the tab containing the website. <br>

                    iii- cookies are small text files that are stored on the client-side by the web server. Cookies
                    store data that needs to stay across different visits to the website.

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-center">Question 3</h2>
                <p class="text-center font-bold">What is event loop and how does it work?</p>
                <p class="text-justify flex justify-center">Ans: The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that
                    handles asynchronous operations. It keeps track
                    of tasks that need to
                    be executed and continuously checks if any of those tasks have completed, allowing the program to
                    run efficiently
                    without blocking the main thread. <br>

                    When an asynchronous operation is called it is added to the
                    event queue rather
                    than being executed immediately.
                    The event loop continuously checks the event queue to see if there are any tasks that have
                    completed.
                    When a task is completed, it is removed from the event queue and its corresponding callback function
                    is executed.
                    This process continues until there are no more tasks in the event queue, at which point the event
                    loop stops until
                    another task is added.
